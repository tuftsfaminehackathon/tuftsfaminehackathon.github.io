We strive to create interdisciplinary, multicultural, and multigenerational teams for both in-person and remote Hackathon participants. Limited team changes may be accommodated, please contact us for any requests. 

[A list of teams for the hackathon is available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/114NRhp4bCfV8YCBRsPd1SzIHijNu-_daIfLqja9U5G0/edit). Please confirm your participation preference (in-person or remote) by February 8, 2023.
