This event is organized by the Famine and Food Crisis Forecasting (FFCF) Center at Tufts University, which is a collaboration between the [Feinstein International Center](https://fic.tufts.edu/) and the Tufts [Initiative for the Forecasting and Modeling of Infectious Diseases (InForMID)](https://sites.tufts.edu/naumovalabs/).

We aim to:
  - **Foster** a learning community of enthusiasts in humanitarian and data science fields
  - **Facilitate** the exchange of ideas across different disciplines, from data science to theorists to humanitarian practitioners
  - **Learn** to work effectively in multi-generational groups with varying levels of technical skills and expertise
  - **Sharpen** statistical, computing, and visualization skills, as well as understand the theory and concepts of faming formation, evolution, and resolution
  - **Recognize** the challenges of both humanitarian work and data science
  - **Understand** limitations and opportunities for forecasting in humanitarian contexts
  - **Deepen** the dialogue around data quality, availability, accessibility, completeness and implications for bias, misinformation, distortion, and mistrust
  - **Develop** and curate datasets to support future research
