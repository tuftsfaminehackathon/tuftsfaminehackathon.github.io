Welcome to the Famine Forecasting Hackathon! We are a group of amazing, and still growing community of both hackers and individuals dedicated to better understanding famines and data around famines. We are glad you are here as one of us and welcome you!

We are dedicated to providing a safe, comfortable environment, and a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, experience of disability, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, political views, previous hackathon attendance or lack of, computing experience or lack of, and chosen programming language or technical skills.

We do not tolerate harassment of any form. Discriminatory or sexual language or imagery will not be tolerated during the hackathon or in relation to any products of the hackathon. Hackathon participants violating these rules will be expelled from this or any following event.

As such, all participants, will be asked to abide by a set of guiding principles:

  - No harassment, including personal attacks.
  - No use of illegal/pirated content.
  - No use of inappropriate imagery or content.
  - No racist, sexist, cissexist, agist or otherwise oppressive behaviors or assumptions.
  - No discrimination based on level of coding skills or knowledge of the context or content. We all have something to contribute.

Please remember that the data we are working on comes from real people in real crises. Every data point you analyze is a human being or region experiencing and trying to cope with incredible hardship. Please respect the data, what it took to collect it and what it means in real-world terms. Our hope is that we can do our little part in creating a better understanding their situation and thereby contributing to overall resilience to famines.

If this is your first hackathon, please check out the [APA Hacking Toolbox](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2020/03/hackathon).  

The Famine Forecasting Hackathon is an event where we can come to learn together and from each other. Participants are expected to respect each other, united by the common desire to create amazing things with data and knowledge over the course of three weekends in the Spring of 2023 and at future events. We are very excited that you can join us! Now, letâ€™s get to hacking some famines
