## Visualization Challenge: Yemen and Ukraine

In our first hackathon, we learned to explore data and created our first dynamic maps. Now, we will develop, design and deploy interactive dashboards and maps. In this hackathon, we will develop an impactful visualization. Your goal is to create an impactful visualization (dynamic map, dashboard, or powerpoint poster) to raise awareness and promote action on famine in Yemen. This will contain both a visual component and a brief description of your work.
If you are satisfied with your outputs on Yemen, we encourage you to explore datasets related to another ongoing crisis in Ukraine.

## Minimal task: dynamic map and timeline of famine

Firstly, you will create a dynamic map and a timeline to describe the context and evolution of the famine system. We recommend you create a dashboard with at least one dynamic map and at least four key indicators to provide context about the famine system. These indicators can include numbers, graphs, and charts of any Famine-related data, such as climate data, famine data, environmental changes, political changes, etc. You should start by exploring the famine, and looking at the drivers of famine as well as the context in which the famine started as a crisis and continued as a system. You should include any statistical analysis or models as well e.g. looking at the influence of climatic and crop changes on the start of the famine in Yemen. 

## Key tasks

  - Collect the data on famine from Ukraine and Yemen.
  - Prepare the data for analysis by cleaning, structuring, and formatting it into a usable format. For more details on what this might look like, see our [Glossary](https://tuftsfaminehackathon.github.io/data/Hackathon_Glossary_FFCF_v2.pdf).
  - Identify the key indicators for mapping famine, such as food insecurity, malnutrition, and hunger. Additionally, Identify key factors that are the potential leading cause of famine in  Ukraine and Yemen.
  - Select the appropriate mapping tool that works best within the team; it can be made of multiple tools.
  - Develop a strategy for creating a dynamic map, including selecting the right visualization method and creating interactive features.
  - Create a prototype of the dynamic map and test it with a sample data set.
  - Refine the map based on feedback and insights from the sample testing.
  - Collect more data, if necessary, and continue refining the map until it meets the project objectives.
  - Publish the final version of the dynamic map on a public platform, such as an online portal or social media site, and share it with relevant stakeholders.
  - Evaluate the impact of the dynamic map on raising awareness and promoting action on famine in Ukraine and Yemen.

## Software 

There is no restriction on which tools you use to complete these visuals. You can use whichever tools you prefer. However, we suggest the following tools:
  - Tableau
    - [How to install Tableau](https://tufts.box.com/v/DataLabRemoteSoftware-Tableau)
  - R
    - You can use R to make an animated graphic, save it as a GIF, and paste that GIF into Powerpoint or Google Slides. See examples [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/animating-your-data-visualizations-like-a-boss-using-r-f94ae20843e3) and [here](https://github.com/isaacfab/tinker/blob/master/animate_with_r/gganimate_example.R).
