We would suggest you attend in person, but you may attend remotely. We will break attendees up by remote and in person status, so be sure to let us know how you will attend.

## Will we analyze data live?
Yes, we will first collect various primary secondary datasets, store those datasets and eventually start analyzing and working with the data.
