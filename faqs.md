## I signed up for the Famine Forecasting Hackathon, but I have a time conflict. Can I still attend? 
Yes. We strongly recommend you attend as many days as you can, as your skills build over each Hackathon, but we welcome all attendees.

## Will the Famine Forecasting Hackathon be virtual? 
We would suggest you attend in person, but you may attend remotely. We will break attendees up by remote and in person status, so be sure to let us know how you will attend.

## Will we analyze data live?
Yes, we will first collect various primary secondary datasets, store those datasets and eventually start analyzing and working with the data.
