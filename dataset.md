The dataset for Hackathon #1 derives from Yemen and contains data on cholera cases and rates, conflict events and fatalities, rainfall, precipitation, malnutrition scores, and market prices for each governorate. This dataset was compiled by [Ryan Simpson](https://sites.tufts.edu/naumovalabs/team/simpson/), [Sofia Babool](https://sites.tufts.edu/naumovalabs/team/sofia-babool-bs-22/), and [Maia C Tarnas](https://sites.tufts.edu/naumovalabs/team/tarnas/) and published in [this research article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9192410/). Published data can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/tuftsfaminehackathon/tuftsfaminehackathon.github.io/raw/master/data/yemen/Yemen_NatureData_FinalDataset.xlsx).

The scientific exercises of the hackathon are:
- Develop a timeline of events relevant to team focus and period of the Yemen crisis (2016-present)
- Develop visualizations and summary tables of available and unavailable data in Yemen during the crisis period
- Create a merged dataset with available characteristics
- Perform preliminary quantitative analysis with the data (summary statistics, regression)
